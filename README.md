## Masked Credentials & Secrets
For security, all sensitive credentials, API keys, tokens, and secrets in this codebase have been replaced with `****MASKED****`.

**To run this project, you must replace all `****MASKED****` placeholders with your own valid values.**

### How to Update Masked Values
1. **Find all `****MASKED****` placeholders** in the codebase. These are used for:
   - Database credentials
   - Email/SMTP credentials
   - API keys and tokens (Gemini, Google GenerativeAI, Twilio, Hugging Face, News APIs, etc.)
   - Any other sensitive values
2. **Replace each `****MASKED****`** with your actual secret value (e.g., API key, token, password, etc.).
   - Never commit real secrets to public repositories.
   - Consider using environment variables or a `.env` file for sensitive data in production.

**Example:**
```python
API_KEY = "****MASKED****"  # Replace with your actual API key
```

**Replace with:**
```python
API_KEY = "your-real-api-key-here"
```

If you have any questions about which values to replace or best practices for secret management, see the Security section above or contact the author.

## Security
- Store sensitive data (DB credentials, API keys) in environment variables
- JWT is used for authentication and session management
